# Compiler (`./compiler`)

The compiler is organized into two main modules: `AST` and `CodeGen`. The compiler directory structure is setup to separate header files from implementations. The implementations are in `lib` directory and the headers are in `include` directory.

Run `make` in the directory to build the compiler. `./expr [filename]` to compile. The LLVM IR will be emitted to a file called `dump.ll`.

# Standard Library (`./stdlib`)

Standard library functions of the language are defined here. Run `make` in the directory to generate a shared object. This file must be linked with the final executable generated by LLVM or load it to the `lli` interpreter (`lli -load lib.so yourfile.ll`).

# Tests (`./tests`)
